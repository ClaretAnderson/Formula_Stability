# Educational Project: ML-Based Formula Stability Prediction

This educational project explores the application of machine learning (ML) for predicting packaging compatibility in the product and packaging development process. By simulating real-world data and implementing various ML algorithms, this project aims to showcase the potential of ML in streamlining and enhancing packaging development processes.

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by the article "Machine learning approach to packaging compatibility testing in the new product development process", published in the Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing (https://doi.org/10.1007/s10845-023-02090-8). This article highlighted the potential of machine learning (ML) to revolutionize packaging compatibility testing by reducing time and cost while improving accuracy.
